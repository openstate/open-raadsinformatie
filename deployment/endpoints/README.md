# OBSOLETE
Google Cloud is not used anymore - this documentation and corresponding software will be removed TBD

# Google Cloud Endpoints
Using Google Cloud Endpoints makes it easy to develop, deploy, protect and monitor APIs.
It provides access to the frontend service through the endpoints-service which can be found here:
`deployment/<namespace>/endpoints-deployment.yaml`.

The `host` value in swagger should correspond to the service argument in the deployment mentioned above.
The `version` in swagger files should match the app version when updated to a new revision.

When logged-in in gcloud in the right project, use the following command to create or update an endpoint.
```bash
$ gcloud endpoints services deploy production.yaml
```
