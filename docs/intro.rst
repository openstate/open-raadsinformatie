Introduction
============

The API contains data from different sources. The API contains a combined index which allows for searching through the
basics of each data source, i.e. the title, description, etc. It also has a separate index for each individual
municipality. The API follows a common design (REST) and document format (JSON), known by many developers.

Features
--------

* Data of different municipalities and provinces is made searchable in a uniform manner.
* When possible, references to the original item's location (in the form of URIs) are included.
* A simple REST API to easily search, filter and retrieve items.
