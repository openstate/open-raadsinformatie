# Maintenance guide ORI

## Adding municipalities

- New municipalities are probably added to the issue tracker.
- Identify supplier (Notubiz / go / etc)
- Move to the relevant `ocd_backend/sources` file.
- Duplicate bottom municipality
- Set key (equal to shortname, dashes allowed)
- Allamak code: https://allmanak.nl/cat/1/Gemeenten, search name, get ID from URL
- For CBS code: https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/classificaties/overig/gemeentelijke-indelingen-per-jaar/indeling%20per%20jaar/gemeentelijke-indeling-op-1-januari-2020
- Optionally set `source_name` if municipality name can't be properly derived from shortname.
- Optionally set `municipality_prefix` if municipality has multiple suppliers per region.
- The next step depends on supplier
- Push to master, semaphore (currently at jurrian's account!) starts deploying. In this step, dependabot might want to update a lib.
- sh to `redis` (see devops)
- `set "ori.{supplier}.{key}"  "all daily monthly"` add municipality
- sh to `backend-{id}`
- start the extraction process for the new municipality `/opt/ori $ python manage.py extract process all --source_path=ori.notubiz.weesp`. They will be set in a list for `celery`, which means that they will be processed in time. You can scale up the amount of workers for `backend` in Google, but it's probably not necessary.
- You can track the progress in the Google cloud logs.
- Update the status per municipality (importing, finished) in the github issue tracker.

### Notubiz

- Go to https://api.notubiz.nl/organisations

### Ibabs

- For finding `ibabs_sitename`, google for `ibabs ${municipality_name}` and derive it from the URL
- Duplicate
- Exclcude / include are rarely required, but can be useful if one instance is shared across municipalitites

### GemeenteOplossingen

- Usually trying a `base_url` that makes sense works fine

## Municipality Changing supplier

- Go to redis (see devops), set source value to "archived" for the older one.

## Finding bugs

- Bugs are reported to [Bugsnag](https://app.bugsnag.com/argu/ori/errors).

## Devops - run redis

- [running on google cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?project=open-raadsinformatie-52162&authuser=1&folder&organizationId)
- connect to cluster with `gcloud` cli
- `kubectl` get pod namespaces to see running pods
- `sh` into `redis`
- `redis-cli`
- `keys _*` see all intervalsÂ¸ e.g. the base start date
- `select 1` go to database 1, where the sources (municipalities) are. This is where you turn the sources on.
- `get ori.ibabs.aalsmeer` => see current status
- `set "ori.ibabs.{key}"  "all daily monthly"` add municipality

## Troubleshooting

- Not enough available disk space can cause downtime. Elastic starts to have issues at 80% disk usage - it starts moving stuff to other instances. Fix this by making the disk larger and copying the contents.
- When dealing with IBabs issues, use SoapUI. You need
- When finding logs for a municipality, use the GCP querybuilder with `textPayload:municipality`

## Reverting a back-up

- Go to GCP -> Kubernetes -> Snapshots
- The snapshot schedule `postgres-weekly` is actually elastic
- Go to disks, create disk, standard disk, source type -> snapshot2

# Folder structure

- **Deployments** for kubernetes files
- **ocd_backend** contains most logic
  - **bin** e.g. kubernetes deploy script
  - **models** Use OpenGov definitions
  - **sources** contain municipalities config
  - **extractor** Responsible for fetching data
  - **loader** Responsible for writing data (e.g. elastic and linked-delta's)
  - **transformers** Responsible for mapping data
  - **enrichers** Extracting text from PDFs, adding locations, adding themes
